        <article id="alex">
          <img alt="Alex Liebman" src="/img/farmers/alex.jpg">

          <p>From a young age, <strong>Alex Liebman</strong> has
          been interested in getting dirty, staying dirty, and
          eating well. After spending time on rural vegetable,
          fruit and livestock operations in Massachusetts and
          California, he is excited to be figuring out how to farm
          in the city.  He wants to develop sustainable urban
          food systems that work in conjunction with rural farms to
          provide fresh, healthy produce to all people.  Alex
          also spends time working with the Latino Economic
          Development Center, helping Latino-led farming
          cooperatives begin successfully throughout the state.
          When not farming, you can find Alex playing the
          saxophone, playing pick-up hockey on the city's rinks, or
          with his eyes pinned to decaying trees searching for
          birds.</p>

          <img alt="Emily Hanson" src="/img/farmers/ermaly.jpg">

          <p><strong>Emily Hanson</strong> transplanted herself to
          the Twin Cities after spending the first 18 years of her
          life in a small town in New Hampshire. She grew up
          helping tending a big vegetable garden in the summers and
          spending every spare moment in the woods behind her
          house, then fled the coop and moved to Minnesota for
          college. As an Environmental Studies major and Geography
          minor at Macalester College, she studied a little of
          everything under the sun. She wants to dedicate her life
          to creating resilient communities- through urban and
          rural sustainable agriculture, neighborhood skill
          sharing, alternative education, and all manner of working
          with her hands. She loves the way farming makes you feel
          rich even when your pockets are filled with dirt instead
          of money.</p>

          <p><strong>Eric Larsen</strong> grew up on a small
          Christmas tree and blueberry farm in Forest Lake, MN. He
          earned a degree in finance and nonprofit management from
          the University of Minnesota in 2008.  Mr. Larsen now
          lives in the Phillips neighborhood of South Minneapolis
          where he's active in the Transition Town movement to
          build resilient communities.  Eric is a proud alumni
          of the AmeriCorps NCCC program where he served on
          projects with nonprofits everywhere from Louisiana to
          Maine.  He's interested in growing food, building
          community with friends and neighbors, cooking, community
          service, dancing, and experiencing other cultures, all of
          which can be found within a short venture from his own
          home!</p>

          "/img/farmers/klaus.jpg">

          <p><strong>Klaus Zimmermann-Mayo</strong> grew up in the
          heart of South Minneapolis, on 17th Avenue. He spent his
          childhood tagging along to his dad's handyman jobs,
          conducting scientific experiments, and digging holes in
          the backyard. With handyman skills acquired from his dad,
          he's spent most of his adult life repairing houses,
          fences, sheds, and just about anything else that needs
          fixing. Upon meeting Emily, Alex, and Robin in the spring
          of 2011, his budding interest in farming grew into a
          full-fledged passion. He spent 2012 working and living in
          Decorah Iowa at a diversified seed-saving homestead, and
          working at a neighboring organic dairy farm. When he's
          not working, he likes to bang on the drums and experiment
          with fermentation.</p>

        <article id="robin">
          <img alt="Robin Major" src="/img/farmers/robin.jpg">

          <p><strong>Robin Major</strong> grew up on a sustainable
          sheep cheese farm in Putney, Vermont and spent many
          summers milking sheep and throwing hay bales.  Since
          leaving the farm, she has built upon her childhood
          experiences by studying biology at Macalester College and
          spending summers working on other farms and garden
          projects.  Since graduating, she has started a small
          urban farm business and spent a season working at Common
          Harvest Farm in Osceola, Wisconsin.  She adores
          perennial flowers, herbs, grasses, and medicines, and is
          the Lady of the Greenhouse. Outside of farming, she
          enjoys long runs and big meals.</p>

          <img alt="John Seitz" src="/img/farmers/john.jpg">

          <p><strong>John Seitz</strong> grew up in Hopkins, MN. He
          fled the coop to educate himself at the University of
          Madison, then at the organic farming program in Santa
          Cruz, California. A master of the knife, he now works as
          a butcher at The Wedge. He began urban farming in 2008,
          and was a founder of Uptown Farmers. A man of many
          talents, he works part-time with the farm, and keeps us
          well fed and on our toes.</p>
