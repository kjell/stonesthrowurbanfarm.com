          <h2>About Our Business</h2>

          <dl>
            <dt>What kind of company is Stone's Throw Urban
            Farm?</dt>

            <dd>Stone's Throw Urban Farm is a Limited Liability
            Partnership (LLP). This means that we function
            internally as a collective- the six owners of the
            business make decisions together about everything from
            daily tasks to long-term visioning. Outwardly, we are a
            commercial farm business- our operating budget comes
            almost completely from the sale of produce, with small
            grants used only to fund specific projects and
            investments. We think that urban farming can be a
            viable business provide a living wage for farmers.</dd>

            <dt>How is the farm financed?</dt>

            <dd>The farm is financed primarily through sale of CSA
            shares and direct marketing of produce at markets and
            restaurants. We also apply for some small grants in
            order to fund specific investments or research
            projects. We have also used Kickstarter, a grassroots
            fundraising platform, to raise capital funds.</dd>

            <dt>Is the farm financially viable?</dt>

            <dd>Yes, with lots of room for improvement. We broke
            even in our first year, but had only minimal funds to
            invest in the next season's up-front costs. In the
            first season, farmers made an average of $6.45/hr,
            significantly below a living wage. Our goal is to be
            able to employ the farm partners and several local
            workers at a living wage.</dd>

            <dt>Where do you sell your produce?</dt>

            <dd>We sell our produce primarily through CSA and
            farmers' market. In our first season, we had 72 CSA
            members (equivalent to 60 full shares). In the 2013
            season, we hope to provide 80-100 full shares. We vend
            our produce weekly at the Mill City Market in downtown
            Minneapolis. We also provide fresh greens and other
            produce to several local restaurants, including St.
            Paul Cheese Shop, France 44 Cheese Shop, Ngon Bistro,
            Tilia, The Gray House, Crema, and Foxy Falafel.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h2>About Our Land</h2>

          <dl>
            <dt>How many plots do you farm?</dt>

            <dd>In 2012 we farmed on 16 plots in the Twin Cities,
            and one rural plot in northwest Hennepin County. 8 of
            our plot were in South Minneapolis, and 8 were in the
            Frogtown and North End neighborhoods of St. Paul. In
            2013, we will be farming on most of the same plots, but
            will also be taking on some new land. Check back for
            details in the spring.</dd>

            <dt>How much land is that?</dt>

            <dd>Our total planted area was just under two acres in
            2012. Our smallest urban plots are about 1/10th of an
            acre, and our largest is 3⁄4 of an acre. Our rural plot
            is about 1.5 acres, which we use primarily to grow
            garlic and other storage crops. In 2013 we aim to
            expand our plantable area.</dd>

            <dt>Do you own the land you farm?</dt>

            <dd>No. We do not own any of the land we farm. We lease
            all of our plots from various types of owners. Some is
            privately owned, some is owned by a bank or
            neighborhood development organization. We generally
            lease the land for free; we offer maintenance and
            general upkeep in exchange for use of the land. As
            such, most of our leases are short-term and conditional
            on the owner's continued desire for us to use the land.
            We do pay rent for a few of our plots, on which we have
            somewhat longer-term leases. We are also exploring
            various other options for securing longer-term land
            tenure- working with schools, non-profits, and starting
            conversations with the Park Board.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h2>About Our Farming Methods</h2>

          <dl>
            <dt>What do you grow?</dt>

            <dd>We grow over fifty varieties of vegetables, a dozen
            herbs, and a smattering of flowers. We primarily grow
            annual veggies because they are planted and harvested
            in the same year and do not require long-term land
            tenure. We hope to move toward growing more perennial
            fruits and nuts in the future. We grow a mixture of
            heirloom (historically important, open-pollinated)
            varieties, as well as many robust hybrids.</dd>

            <dt>  Is the farm organic?</dt>

            <dd>We grow our vegetables according to organic
            principles, and we do not use any synthetic or chemical
            fertilizers, insecticides or herbicides. We are not
            certified organic by the USDA nor do we plan to apply
            for organic certification. Instead of synthetic
            fertilizers, we use lots of compost, an organic dried
            turkey manure product called Sustane, straw and leaf
            mulch, and kelp for seedlings. For pest and disease
            control, we use compost tea and manually remove bugs
            and diseased plants. For weed control, we use our
            hands, hoes, and are working on constructing
            bicycle-powered cultivating tractor.</dd>

            <dt>How do you transform vacant lots into farms?</dt>

            <dd>Once we've found a farm plot, secured a lease,
            tested the soil, and secured a water source from
            neighbors, it's time to till. We use a BCS walk-behind
            tractor to kill the sod and turn the soil. This machine
            looks like a big rototiller, but it's much more
            adaptable- it can tow implements just like a tractor,
            but is pushed by a human. After we till the soil, we
            bring in lots of compost and form beds (rows). Now
            we're ready to start our crops!</dd>

            <dt>How do you grow fresh produce in a polluted
            city?</dt>

            <dd>
              Pollution is definitely a concern for city farmers.
              In our city, the soil pollutants of greatest concern
              are lead, which comes primarily from house paint
              residues, and arsenic, which was dispersed by wind in
              the Seward, Phillips, and Powderhorn neighborhoods of
              Minneapolis. We test our soil before growing in it,
              and do not grow on any lots whose lead levels exceed
              the EPA's "safe" level of 300 PPM. Some scientific
              studies have also shown that plants do not readily
              take up lead into their tissues, and are less likely
              to take up heavy metal molecules in the presence of
              organic matter. We add ample compost to our soil each
              time we plant, and are confident that the produce we
              grow is healthy. We live in a polluted world, but we
              are growing the healthiest food we can given the
              circumstances. For more information on the science of
              contaminated soil see: <a href=

              by potato plants</a>.
            </dd>

            <dt>What do you do in the winter?</dt>

            <dd>We farm actively about 8-9 months of the year (late
            February- November). During the winter months, we do
            lots of planning, meeting, building projects, dreaming
            and scheming, and spreading the word about our farm.
            Currently, we all also take on part-time non-farming
            jobs during the winter months to make ends meet.</dd>

            <dt>Why Urban Farming?</dt>

            <dd>We city dwellers will always rely on rural farmers
            for the bulk of our calories, and the relationship
            between urban and rural communities is vital. But
            having farms inside the city is opportunity to provide
            for our basic needs while enriching our communities.
            Urban farms can provide ultra-fresh produce to nearby
            markets, create valuable pockets of green space, and
            provide a place for people to interact around a common
            interest: food.</dd>
          </dl>
