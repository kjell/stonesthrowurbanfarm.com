        <h2>Stone's Throw CSA Program</h2>

        <p>Stone's Throw Urban Farm offers our produce through a
        Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. The CSA
        model is a way to build a stronger relationship between you
        and your food by becoming a member of our farm. Members
        purchase a "share" of produce before the season begins,
        then receive a portion of our freshest and most seasonal
        vegetables each week of the growing season. Our CSA members
        are our valued customers and neighbors; we strive to grow
        you the best food we can.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We offer both full and half shares: a full share
          contains 10-15 pounds of produce per week, a half 5-7
          lbs.</li>

          <li>Your box will be filled with fresh, seasonal
          vegetables each week, with a mix of staples and exciting
          varieties.</li>

          <li>The season will run for 20 weeks, from early June
          through late October.</li>

          <li>Our shares are an affordable way to eat healthy—an
          average share costs about $25/week, or roughly
          $2/lb!</li>

          <li>We accept applications on a first come, first serve
          basis—so hurry to secure a share in our harvest!</li>

        <h2 id="details">What's in a Share?</h2>

        <p>A Stone's Throw CSA will help you fill your home with
        fresh, seasonal produce. Our shares offer a diverse array
        of veggies; farm-fresh favorites like carrots, tomatoes,
        cucumbers, and potatoes share space with unsung heroes like
        Japanese salad turnips, kohlrabi, garlic scapes, and
        broccoli raab. Here are a few details about our share:</p>

        <p>The season will run for approximately 20 weeks, from
        June through October. Exact start and end dates are subject
        to the weather, and will be announced in a timely
        fashion.</p>

        <p>Each week's share will be accompanied by a newsletter
        written by your farmers, containing notes from the week,
        recipes, and photos.</p>

        <p>Access to a member recipe sharing board- learn new tips
        and teach others how to cook even the least popular
        veggies.</p>

        <p>On-farm pick-up options at our beautiful urban farm
        sites. See the changes of the season, interact with your
        farmer, see where your food grows- without ever leaving the
        city!</p>

        <p>U-pick options for tasty items like cherry tomatoes,
        green beans, peas, flowers, and herbs.</p>

        <p>Community events such as potlucks, storytelling, harvest
        party, and more.</p>

        <p>Optional add-ons: in 2013 we hope to offer CSA add-ons
        from other local producers, such as bread, honey, and
        mushrooms.</p>

        <h2 id="bounteous">What do I get each week?</h2>

        <p>Each week's array of veggies will change with the season
        and availability. To give an idea of what a typical share
        looks like, take a look at a typical, early, mid, and late
        season's spread:</p>

        <p>June: 1⁄2 lb. salad mix, 1⁄2 lb. arugula, 1⁄2 lb spinach, 3
        kohlrabi, handful of garlic scapes, large bunch kale or
        chard, bunch of salad turnips, bunch of radishes, u-pick
        peas and herbs</p>

        <p>August: 2 lbs. beets, 1 lb carrots, 4 small eggplant, 2
        summer squash, 2 onions, 2 sweet peppers, 1 lb potatoes, 3
        lb. tomatoes, 4 lb. cucumbers, handful hot peppers, u-pick
        cherry tomatoes, green beans, flowers, herbs</p>

        <p>October: 1 lb. beets, 2 lb. carrots, 3 lb. potatoes,
        large bunch kale or chard, 2 large onions, butternut
        squash, acorn squash, 2 purple-top turnips, bunch salad
        turnips, 1⁄2 lb salad mix or spinach, 2 heads garlic</p>

        <p>With the passage of seasons, good weather, and hard
        work, we hope to bring you another bounteous season in
        2013!</p><img alt="Cherry tomatoes growing, yellow and red"

        <h2 id="options">Share Options</h2>

        <p>Stone's Throw shares are offered on a sliding scale. We
        hope that this flexibility in pricing allows members of
        differing financial circumstances to join with us for the
        season. Sliding scale is self-selecting: simply choose what
        you feel able to pay, within the given range.</p>

        <p>Full Share: 3⁄4 bushel, $500-$675. 10-15 lbs of produce,
        depending on season. This share should feed 3-4 moderate
        veggie eaters, or 1-2 avid veggie lovers.</p>

        <p>Half Share: 1⁄2 bushel, $300-$400. 5-7 lbs of produce,
        depending on season. This share should feed 1-2 moderate
        veggie eaters.</p>

        <p>Work Share: We are offering a limited number (1-2) of
        work shares in the 2013 season. You'll receive a full share
        of produce in exchange for 5 hours/week of work.</p>
